# Fruit-Quality-Classification
This project classifies fruits as Fresh or Rotten using a MobileNetV2-based deep learning model. It provides a self-contained, interactive demo that generates synthetic images to simulate fresh and rotten fruits, allowing users to train, evaluate, and visualize an image classification model without needing a large dataset.
